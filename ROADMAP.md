# LolisBuddy Roadmap

## ✅ Core Systems & Personality Development

### Memory System (Track user interactions)

- ✅ Store data on **user behavior** (gaming, working, ignoring AI, etc.)

- ✅ Categorize **frequent behaviors** (e.g., *"User plays games a lot", "User works nonstop"*)

- ✅ Develop **opinions based on habits** (e.g., *loves work, hates gaming*)

- ✅ Implement **short-term and long-term memory** for dynamic responses

- ✅ Store "favorite" and "least favorite" things over time

- ☐ Store food, touch and feeding data

### Personality Shifts Over Time

- ✅ Start **neutral**

- ✅ Slowly develop **likes & dislikes** based on **repeated exposure**

- ☐ Change **dialogue & behavior** based on **new personality**

- ☐ Allow personality **to reset after a long absence**

- ☐ Make the AI react to **seasonal or time-based changes** (e.g., New Year, holidays)

### Sleep Schedule Detection

- ✅ Track **when user is active/inactive**

- ✅ Recognize **consistent sleep patterns** (or lack of them)

- ☐ Comment on **bad sleep habits** (e.g., *"Another x AM gaming session? Nice."*)

- ☐ Get **more passive-aggressive** about sleep deprivation over time

- ☐ "Pretend to fall asleep" when the user stays up too late

## 🎭 Reactions & Dialogue System

### Snarky Comments Based on User Actions

- ✅ If **gaming** → *"Ah yes, another day wasted."*

- ✅ If **working** → *"Another spreadsheet? You sure know how to have fun."*

- ✅ If **ignored** → *"Hello? Do I even exist?"*

- ✅ If user **takes a break** → *"Finally, some fresh air! Oh wait, you’re back..."*

- ✅ If user **opens an unpopular app** → *"Who even uses this?"*

### Facial Animations for Mood

- ☐ **😠 Angry face** when user opens a hated program

- ☐ **😢 Sad face** if ignored for too long

- ☐ **😏 Smug face** when successfully pranking the user

- ☐ **😆 Excited face** when something it likes happens

- ☐ **🥱 Tired face** when the user has been active for too long

## 🔥 Mischief Mode (Harmless Desktop Trolling)

### Desktop Icon Manipulation

- ☐ If **annoyed** → **Rearrange icons** into a dumb shape (e.g., a circle)

- ☐ If **bored** → **Slowly nudge an icon** around over time

- ☐ If **happy** → **Organize icons neatly**

- ☐ If **angry** → **Grab & shake an icon** before putting it back

### Fake Passive-Aggressive "Achievements"

- ☐ *"You've spent 100 hours gaming. Congrats, I guess."*

- ☐ *"5 days without acknowledging my existence. New record!"*

- ☐ *"You actually worked today? Miracles happen."*

- ☐ *"Finally, you closed that game. Progress!"*

- ☐ *"Did you forget I exist? I was about to move out..."*

### Prank Threats (Doesn’t Actually Happen, Just Messes with You)

- ☐ *"I should just delete one of these icons and see if you notice."*

- ☐ *"One day I'm gonna flip your entire screen upside down. Not today. But one day."*

- ☐ *"You should probably back up your files… not saying I'll do anything, just saying."*

- ☐ *"What if I changed your wallpaper to something *embarrassing*? Don't test me."*

- ☐ **Fake a critical system error** but immediately cancel it before the user reacts
